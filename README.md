During our internship from Africa to Silicon Valley, our team developed a Social Media Web API using ASP.NET Framework [repo]([url](https://github.com/RealEskalate/2023-project-phase-starter-projects/tree/main/aait/backend/group-1B)). This project aimed to meet specific requirements:

## Project Requirements
- **Clean Architecture:** The codebase was structured using clean architecture principles.
- **Entity Framework:** Utilized as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for seamless database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL:** Chosen as the database management system to store and manage data.
- **Swagger:** Employed as the API documentation tool for enhanced clarity and understanding.

## Features
The project boasted several key features, including:
- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented JWT for secure user access.
- **Follow/Unfollow Functionality:** Users could follow/unfollow other users within the platform.
- **Posting & Commenting:** Users were able to create posts and comment on other users' posts.
- **Notification System:** Users received notifications when the individuals they followed made new posts.

This project was an amalgamation of technologies and functionalities, aiming to create a robust social media API using ASP.NET.
